# JOINMI

## Inspiration

Improving the mass invitation process for multiple social circles to impromptu events. 


## What it does

*Connect using social media, import contacts across all platforms 

*Create smart groups to sort all contacts from different social circles; group event preferences will be saved

*"Think", "create", and "invite" using smart event card templates within seconds 

*Option for invitees to "contest" the event "location" and "time" using a upvoting & downvoting 

*Sponsored event "ads" curated for the user, generates revenue 


## How we built it

*We combined our mobile design knowledge, with our web development skills to create a mobile app without Java or Objective-C (or Swift). 

*The design process involved brainstorming UI elements using pen & paper, creating a rough wireframe using Balsamiq, creating design assets using Adobe Photoshop and Sketch 3 (Bohemian Coding), creating beautiful and efficient user flows using Invision.


## Challenges we ran into

*Avoiding aliasing and keeping the images crisp on such a large resolution (1920 x 1080 px) 

*Creating a mobile application with HTML and CSS (using a plugin)


## Accomplishments that we're proud of

*Crisp graphical assets

*Simple & intuitive UI

*Designed for all target personas and use cases in mind, for both the average user and the power user 

*Drawer animation (hamburger menu)

*Cute penguin

## What we learned

*Never code a mobile app using HTML and CSS

## What's next for Joinmi

*Use machine learning to suggest and auto-populate reoccurring and recommended invites 

*Further backend development, servers, etc.
